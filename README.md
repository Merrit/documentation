# Flathub docs

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

You can access it on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) then.

If port 3000 is already in use and you see an error, use

```
$ yarn start --port PORT
```

to start it on a different port. See the [Docusaurus manual](https://docusaurus.io/docs/cli#docusaurus-cli-commands)
for other arguments available.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
