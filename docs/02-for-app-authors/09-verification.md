# Verification

## What is verification?

Verification is a process by which Flathub can confirm that an app is published by its original developer or a third party approved by the developer. This is done by verifying the developers identity using a link to their website or to their profile on a source code hosting site.

## I'm publishing an app on Flathub. How do I get it verified?

First, [log in to Flathub](https://www.flathub.org/login). Go to the developer tab, if you're not already there. Click the "Developer Settings" button under the app you want to verify. At the top of the page, find the "Setup Verification" section. The instructions there will walk you through the verification process.

### I'd like to verify my app that someone else already published

The first step is to gain ownership over  your app; see [Someone else has put my app on Flathubâ€”what do I do?](https://docs.flathub.org/docs/for-app-authors/submission#someone-else-has-put-my-app-on-flathubwhat-do-i-do)
